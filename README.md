# bybitbot

This project aims to build a trading bot that connects to the Bybit API. The goal is to automatically detect whether the market is trending or ranging and execute strategies accordingly.

## Features (planned)
- Connection to the Bybit REST/WebSocket API
- Basic framework for strategy modules
- Detection of trend versus range conditions
- Placeholder code for further development

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Python 3.10+ and create a virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies (to be defined).
4. Run `python main.py` to see a simple placeholder message.

Work in progress.
